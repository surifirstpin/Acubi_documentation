Reports describes how to retrieves the data in the desired combinations as per your business needs and how to explore particular subject area it self. It has an ability on how to pull the data and modify the report as per the needs and drill down deeper into the report for more better insights across the report.

 To create a report, Click on **Reports Section.**

**1.**  All the connection established, databases and tables used for the Reports are defined under **Project.** Depending on your business requirement you can choose appropriate project.

**For Example :** If you want to create a project based on oracle connection select project **Oracle_new** from drop down list.

**2.** **Model** Section has different set of models developed  for Orders, Customers, Delivery, Employees, Kitchen Process and Products.

**For Example:** to create a report on order based details, Select **Bi_Orders** from given drop down list. 
 
 **3.** To refresh a report click on, **Reset** ( refresh icon). 

## Getting Started

The data in analyse sections is determined by dimensions and measures.

**4.**  Using **Field Picker**, select Dimensions and Measures to retrieve the data based on the selection made. In AcuBi a dimension is derived as group of data and Measure is derived as information about group of data.

 > **Note :** All the dimensions appear blue in  colour and all the measures appear in Orange colour in your data table.

Let us generate a query to display Stationcode (Dimension) and Order Attendant ID (Dimension) with Quantity Sum. 

**5.** After Selecting dimensions and measures, hit the **Run** button to extract and display the data.
In the following example we have selected **Two Dimensions and One Measure Field.**

> **Note :**  Data retrieved on running a report, is visible in  **Data Section**

**6.** To hide the Explore /visualize section that displays dimensions and measure click on  **angle double left** icon. to display the explore/visualize section click  **angle double right** icon available near dimensions and measure field list.

## Report Filters

Report filters will narrow the reports results while allowing you to view the specific range of data. 

**The following are the various types of filter expressions used.**

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| **String** | For fields that contain letters or special characters |
|**Numbers**|For fields that contain numeric
|
|**Date**|For fields that contain dates|
|**Lookup**| To view the lookup in Report filters it should be derived under lookup field in model section|


**Following are the different types of filters characteristics applicable :**

> **Note :** To view the **Timeline Filters** in details please go to Timeline filters document.

**7.** To Add Filter to a report, Click on **Add Filter.** The report data is retrieved based on **Filter** applied if any. All the fields selected are visible in filter expression list using which you can apply filters.

> **For Example :** Apply filter expression to measure field **Quantity sum is greater than or equal to 1000** in filter section and data is retrieved on based on the filters applied.

  -  Hit the **Run** button, data is displayed based on the filters applied.

**8.** Similarly, we can apply **Hidden Filters** to the report data, By Clicking on Filter Icon available in field list of a report. The data can also be retrieved based on the applied hidden filters, this hidden filters are visible in the list of filter expression but are hidden in data section.

**9.** To Delete the filter applied Click **Cross Icon** as shown in the image below.

## Order (Ascending / Descending)

**8.** To view the report data in ascending or descending orders, click on  **Order**  and add the column fields in order section.
         **a.** To add more sorting orders to a report click **Add Order**.
         **b.** To delete, sorting for fields click **Ban Icon.**

**9.** To hide the **Filter** or **Order** sections, click on angle-double-up icon on to far right of the order section. To un-hide the same click on angle-double-down icon.

## Local Sorting

**10.** Sorting can also be applied after data is retrieved in data section, you can simply click on desired field header to enable sorting.

For  **Dimensions**

-   Click on upper arrow to enable ascending order.
-   Click on down arrow to enable descending order.

For  **Measures** use opposite direction.

-   Click on upper arrow to enable descending order.
-   Click on down arrow to enable ascending order.

**11.** The total time taken to build a query for a report is displayed at top of the report screen.

**12.** The total number of rows fetched displayed just below that.
  
**13.**  Select the  **check box** for totals, to display total sum values of the measure fields.

**14.**  You can **limit** the rows to 100, 500, 1000, 5000, etc using given drop down list.

## Pivot

Multiple dimensions in a report data are often easier to look at, when you pivot one of the dimensions horizontally and display group based data for the field to which pivot is applied. To **Pivot** a dimension click pivot for a dimension field.

**Pivot can be applied in 2 ways :**
 
**a.** Apply pivot **After Retrieving** the data by selecting the pivot option using field header drop down.
 
**b.** You can also apply pivot **Before Retrieving** the data, just click on pivot icon during field selection.

> **Note :** incase if you are using more than one pivot, make sure you have at least one un-pivoted dimension and a measure value.

**Pivot Example** : if you want to view quantity sum based on station code then apply pivot for station code (Dimension) as shown in below image.

## Hide data in pivot 

To hide pivoted data in report output, choose pivot hide first ( hides 1st column data in list) or choose pivot hide last (hides last column data in a list) in data section under datasets.


## Pin or Remove Pin

**15.** To freeze the column field values while scrolling the data to right or left, select **Pin** option in field drop down and to release the same select **Remove Pin.**

## Group / Un-Group

By selecting group option for a field you can display the consolidated value of the field. 

**16.** To carry out this function select  **Group** in field drop down and to release the same select **Un-Group**. 

## Multi-Level grouping

To carry out Multi-level grouping on the data extracted. Select group option for two dimension fields in drop down list. 

> **For Example** : To get it clear on multi grouping, i am adding one more dimension fields **Payment_mode** to the report. Select group option for **Stationcode** and **Order_attendant_ID.** Now on expanding Stationcode_2, it displays corresponding **Order_attendant_ID** on further expanding, it displays the **payment mode** for the records as shown in the image below.

**17.**  To find the specific field value, from the data extracted select **Find** in the field drop down.


**18.**  To hide the specific field in the visualization charts select **Hide Visualization** in the drop down list  and to display the same select **Show visualization.**

**19.**  To remove a specific field column from the extracted list, select **Remove** in drop down list.

## Calculated column

Calculated column functionality allows you to manipulate the retrieved data, using arithmetical, logical, text-based and date-based functions and then displays it in the required format. 

> **Note :** To understand the total functionality of Calculated column, **"Refer Calculated Column Document".**

Click on  **Calculated column**  button to enable table calculations as shown in below image,

![
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sv18042016/fp1/3fb590c409cd0e47262a69c18bbde38f424ca714/images/calculated_col.png)

> **Note :** in the below example we are multiplying measure field quantity_sum by 2.

After navigating to calculated column, enter below fields;

-   **Field name**  unique identifier name to refer calculated column.
    
-   **Label**  labeling the calculated column.
    
-   **Data type**  data type used (string,number).
    
-   **Field type**  derives dimension or measure.
    
-   **Calculation**  derive arithmetical & logical expressions.
    
-   **Calculate on raw data**  By enabling the field **Calculate on Raw** the calculation is applied on all the rows irrespective of grouping and pivot settings, if disabled calculation applied on abstract values only.
